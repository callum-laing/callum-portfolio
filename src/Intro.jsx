        <h2>Hey! I&apos;m Callum, a Web Developer based in Cambridge, UK.</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into web development started with a simple curiosity about
          how the web works, which soon grew into a love for building sleek,
          responsive designs that are both functional and visually engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and the satisfaction of
          seeing a project come together. Whether itâ€™s refining a user interface
          or making sure a site works seamlessly across devices, I take pride in
          creating clean, efficient code and delivering experiences that are
          intuitive and accessible.
        </p>
        <p>Currently seeking my next adventure as a Developer!</p>
